          <br />
          <p>
            Starting off with something simple, Harvest Hero Origins throws the
            player back to the third generation of consoles with its 8-bit
            graphics and simple-yet-addicting gameplay. In this game you play as
            one of five heroes to defend the village of Fronvale from an army of
            Grooble, with each hero having a different playstyle, and different
            ways of approaching oncoming enemies. You can also destroy oncoming
            boulders that contain power-ups such as a fire ring to destroy
            anything near you, and as the game goes on you'll be blessed with
            new moves to make defending the village much easier. Of course as
            the game implies, you can also harvest any vegetables growing on the
            battlefield… they don't do much, but you can harvest them for
            additional points if you wish to upload your score to the
            leaderboard. As for content, the game offers a survival mode for the
            player to either go solo, or to have a friend join in to help clear
            out hordes of enemies charging towards the village, and a story
            mode, telling the tale of the titular Harvest Hero. If you're into
            something like The Legend of Zelda on NES with its combat, and/or
            you just so happen to have a friend nearby, you'll be sure to have a
            good time with this game. Of course however, the game does have
            Origins in it's title, and it's not just there for show either, as
            this is just the beginning for what Gemdrop Games has to offer,
            though this game will be what they have to show for the time being,
            as they are actively developing their next title.

          <br />
          <p>
            Imagine Pac-Mania, but your goal is to serve the ghosts food without
            bumping into them, that's Carrie's Order Up in a nutshell. You play
            as a crab waiter named Carrie devoted to serving customers their
            meals, so much so that she won't stop for anything… not even for
            other customers. That however isn't a huge issue for her, as she's
            able to spin her way around the customers should she be on a
            collision course towards them, all while keeping any food OR plates
            stable, and there's an extra emphasis on that OR for a reason,
            because Carrie can only carry either food to serve to customers OR
            plates left behind to wash in the sink for extra cash. The big thing
            here is to avoid falling to the ground from bumping into customers,
            spinning over puddles, or slipping on banana peels, but it's not the
            end of the world if you fall for any reason as you can get rid of a
            miss by collecting enough coins that the customers drop… oh yeah I
            should also mention that the game uses a miss system rather than a
            lives system. The game is also generous enough to lend you power-ups
            to get through your job, like a mirror to phase through customers,
            and roller skates to increase your speed temporarily. This game also
            has a story mode where you play through a set assortment of levels
            that ramp up in difficulty, while showing the lives of Carrie the
            Crab Waiter and Calcia the Lobster Cook in-between checkpoints. The
            developer, inkDragonWorks, is also actively developing another game
            called Poppin & Jupa: Pocket Adventure, so definitely check him out
            when you get a chance.

            #8: The Unlikely Legend of Rusty Pup
          </h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            All our entries have been quite bright in color and tone so far,
            haven't they? Get ready for some whiplash (kinda). The Unlikely
            Legend of Rusty Pup takes you to a Gothic and grungy steampunk world
            made of scrap metal with the sole task of making sure that a lone
            robot dog makes it through this unforgiving environment. However
            something important to note is that the game doesn't let you control
            the dog itself, instead you play as some sort of magic hand that has
            the ability to push-and-pull all sorts of contraptions to create
            paths for this robo-pup to safely traverse through, which includes
            making sure the little one doesn't fall from too great of a height
            and ensuring that it has enough fuel to last for the level. A major
            positive in this game is that you have to pet the dog in order to
            wake it up for the level to start, and if you disagree with that,
            you're just statistically and scientifically wrong. It's is a very
            welcome addition to the indie space even if often overlooked. If
            you've enjoyed games like Lemmings, Ghost Trick, or even the Mario
            vs. Donkey Kong games post-GBA, I'd say give this game a try if you
            haven't. If any of that hasn't convinced you… well… you know
            Rareware, right? And you know Conker's Bad Fur Day, right? The man
            behind that game, Chris Seavor, is the man behind this game as well.
          </p>
          The game is available on

            >Steam</a
          >, though it's worth noting that it was planned for the Nintendo 3DS
          and Wii U only for those to be canned, and the Switch version is
          vaporware at this point.

          <h1 style="font-weight: bolder">#7: Cool Kid Cody</h1>
          <p>
            Don't let the game's engine fool you, this is more than just some
            visual novel, it's cooler because now it's a point-and-click
            adventure. Cool Kid Cody is a game where you play as the local cool
            kid, Cody, in a world where cool people and losers are considered
            separate, gotta love how the game pretty much introduces this
            world's version of classicism in its opening. Joking aside, the game
            has a lot of charm to it, with its neon palette and funny dialogue
            when interacting with various objects in the world. The general gist
            of the game is that in your cool school, you're assigned a loser
            named PB, that pizza boy you see in the art, for the Chill
            Assignment Test and that's really about as far as I know about the
            plot and therefore a good ending point on talking about the plot.
            Admittedly I haven't gotten far into the game, but I'm already
            somewhat hooked on it, certainly helps that I played another game
            made by the same team, Purrfect Apawcalypse, a game where you try to
            make friends while trying not to die, but we're not talking about
            that game right now. Speaking of the same team however, the game's
            art style was even done by one of Jaiden Animations' team members,
            90% Denny, so if you're into Jaiden, you may want to try something
            one of her animators made. Overall, the dialogue is good and so is
            the art style, and though I haven't gotten to really know the
            characters, I feel like I'll really start to get attached to some of
            them. The game is separated into episodes and seasons somewhat like
            the Telltale Games before they went under, although the first
            episode of every season is free to play, so if you just want to try
            the game out you're free to do so. If you like the odd dialogue of
            the EarthBound games and other Motherlikes, and/or you enjoy
            point-and-click adventures, you should at least play the first
            episode of season 1, since it's already free to play. Also consider
            checking out more of what 90% Studios does with art being done by
            Denny and programming being done by Andy.

          <h1 style="font-weight: bolder">#6: Dragon Drop</h1>
          <p>
            To be specific, the one made by Cloudy Games LLC, there are two
            different games named Dragon Drop. With that out of the way, Dragon
            Drop is a game where you play as what looks like a dragon you'd see
            out of a Kirby game, called a pico dragon. When starting a game you
            can choose your pico dragon and what they wear, and you have the
            ability to either breathe fire and send blocks beneath falling, or
            taunt for the heck of it, and something happens when you press taunt
            next to another pico dragon. You also have a variety of stages to
            choose from, consisting of various shapes to avoid falling from. The
            general goal of the game is dependent on the game mode, with the
            main and first one being Classic Stock, so we'll go over that real
            quick. In Classic Stock, everyone is given five lives, and you all
            compete to be the last one standing as you send blocks falling with
            your fire breath, the more players that strike out, the smaller the
            battlefield gets, so you have to be careful constantly. And like I
            said there are other game modes to try out like Earthquake,
            Quickdraw, Rapture, and Spleef, so if you get tired of Classic,
            there's other modes to try out. If you like Bomberman, Mario Party,
            Gang Beasts, really any free-for-all game you would play with
            friends, have a get together and try this game out. The developers
            are hard at work at this game, and if you've ever gotten a charity
            itch.io bundle from itch themselves, chances are this game is one of
            the many games included in said bundle, though I'd say donate to the
            game itself to support it if you really do like it, it helps the
            developer to finish it.

          <p>
            Looks like the evolution of pixel art indies has finally arrived,
            with Frogun being one of a bunch of games with a low-poly art-style.
            In this game you play as a girl who sets out to save her parents
            using her primary tool and friend, the Frogun. You'll go through all
            sorts of levels, solving puzzles and collecting gems. Something
            worth noting is that you are rewarded for going through each level
            within a certain condition, such as getting to the goal before X
            amount of time, with all the gems collected, without getting hit,
            and whatnot, but don't worry about doing all that in one go, once
            you meet a threshold, that reward will be saved and added onto
            additional revisits of the levels. The game also allows you to
            change filters to better suit the game, so whether you want to play
            in crisp HD to see every detail or through some fuzzy scanlines to
            take you back is up to you. If you like games like Ape Escape, you
            should give Frogun a try. The developer, Molegato is even making a
            sequel, Frogun Encore, so you should check that out as well when it
            releases.

          <h1 style="font-weight: bolder">#4: Goodboy Galaxy</h1>
          <p>
            Do you want to go to space? Do you want to explore all sorts of
            planets? Do you want to make all sorts of friends along the way? And
            do you want to do all of that as a dog? Then you should know more
            about this game because it has all that and more. Goodboy Galaxy is
            a game where you're the last hope your planet has, as you seek out
            to the stars to find some help for your home. “How do you do that?”
            you may ask, well by gathering connections of course, and weapons as
            well because though you get to explore planets and meet new friends,
            there are plenty of creatures out there that are hostile and
            wouldn't exactly be considered friends. That's really all that I
            know about this game, considering the fact that it hasn't exactly
            released yet, however there is a demo to try out and to get a feel
            of the game. The neat thing about the demo, and the game in general
            however, is that it is all playable on the Game Boy Advance on
            actual hardware, with physical cartridges being available to
            preorder, or just the ROM to play through a flash cartridge or
            emulator. What the demo shows is an incredibly solid game where you
            traverse a cave with certain gear of yours being taken away
            temporarily, like exploring without your blaster, rendering you
            unable to shoot, or exploring without a jet-pack, making it very
            difficult to jump. The demo is simple and short, but does show what
            the game is about, and there's even a guest appearance from another
            game being made on the NES called Orange Island. If you're into
            games like Metroid or Cave Story, I'm sure you'll have a good time
            with this game. So why put this game on this list if it hasn't
            released? Well it's set to release winter of this year (2023). It's
            already October as of writing this, so the release day is swiftly
            approaching. I simply wanted to bring more attention to this game.
          </p>
          The demo is out on <a href="https://hotpengu.itch.io/goodboy-galaxy-demo">itch.io</a> and the game is set to release on there
          alongside Steam, Nintendo Switch, the Evercade and the Game Boy
          Advance.

          <h1 style="font-weight: bolder">#3: Guacamelee!</h1>
          <p>
            Ever wanted to play as a super-powered luchador fighting
            poncho-wearing skeletons alongside a guardian named after some
            Mexican food while hearing all sorts of trumpets along the way? That
            sounds stereotypical, but you'd be wrong, that's just another
            Tuesday for Mexico, just ask any Mexican, mi tio would never lie
            about stuff like that. Guacamelee! is a game where you do all of
            what I mentioned earlier with the sole goal of saving El
            Presidente's daughter, a childhood friend of yours, from the
            clutches of Carlos Calaca, who plans on merging the land of the
            living and land of the dead to rule over both realms.. No one is
            exactly happy with this plan, not even El Diablo de la Biblia, so
            it's your job to stop the merge from happening. You do this by
            gathering new moves to get past obstacles blocking your progress and
            by combo-ing the hell out of anything that stands in your way with
            souped up luchador moves. The game can also be played with a second
            player, and with an updated re-release called the “Super Turbo
            Chanpionship Edition”, you can even play with a maximum of four
            players to send everything flying with your skills. If you liked
            Dust: An Elysian Tail, Guacamelee! is sure to satisfy your desire to
            combo the living hell out of everything. There's also a sequel
            simply titled Guacamelee! 2, which despite improving upon the first
            game, is still a direct sequel to it, and I'd recommend finishing
            that game first to really enjoy what the sequel throws at you.
          </p>
          The game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/32402/Guacamelee_Complete/">Steam</a>, Epic Games, Nintendo Switch, PS4, and
          Xbox One. It even got a Vita release if you're curious.

          <h1 style="font-weight: bolder">#2: Rivals Of Aether</h1>
          <p>
            Look, I may be friends with furries, but there's more reason as to
            why I put this game here. Rivals of Aether is a platform fighter
            where you have 18 characters to choose from, two of which are Ori
            and Shovel Knight. I can't say whether it plays like Melee, but it
            definitely pulls techniques from competitive Melee and makes them
            much more fleshed out, and they're not only fleshed out either, the
            game also trains the player on how to use said techniques. The best
            part being that the techniques are easier to pull off, let me tell
            you it's fun to just wavedash with no real purpose other than the
            fact that I can. It has a story mode, but you can tell it was made
            during the very early days of the game, with new lore being spread
            among promo material and four comics. With all that being said, I
            would recommend it for being fresh alone, however the game has a
            very active Steam Workshop, allowing for entirely custom characters
            made (mostly) from the ground up, new stages to play, and buddies
            that can either watch you battle or change the game up in a way. If
            you like Super Smash Bros, Melee in particular, this games does try
            to hit close to home with that, with different mechanics to make it
            more of its own thing and for competitiveness's sake. There's, once
            again, a sequel in the works set to release soon as well from Aether
            studios, making the game 3D and hopefully fleshing out the
            characters more.
          </p>
          The game is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One. Worth
          noting that the PC version is the most supported version and one again
          has Steam Workshop support, while the Xbox version has not gotten an
          update in a long time (funny given Dan Fornace, the creator, used to
          work for them)

          <h1 style="font-weight: bolder">#1: Grapple Dog</h1>
          <p>
            This game is not my personal favorite game of all time, but
            absolutely one that deserves more attention. In this game you play
            as a dog named Pablo, who traverses through levels using a grappling
            hook and a few moves of your own while fighting robots terrorizing
            various islands. Why are the robots terrorizing everyone, well… It's
            kinda your fault, but not really at the same time. After falling
            from a bridge you find a robot head who seems harmless enough and
            even gives you the grappling hook you use throughout the game,
            however after you help him out, he reveals his true intentions on
            destroying everything and even tries to kill you by throwing you
            into the ocean. You of course survive, but now it's up to you, your
            archaeological mentor, and your mechanical friend to stop the robot
            menace from destroying everything. The gameplay is especially solid,
            but the music really ramps things up, taking heavy inspiration from
            Jet Set Radio. The soundtrack really sets the tone of the game, as
            you travel through various levels and solve puzzles to collect gems
            in order to fight the bosses of each world. If you like Bionic
            Commando and/or Hideki Naganuma's music, this game has the grappling
            hooks and funky beats to keep you hooked. Another sequel soon too.
            By Medallion Games. Space this time. You'll most likely enjoy it if
            you like the first one.
          </p>
          The game is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series (Odd that there's no One version...).
