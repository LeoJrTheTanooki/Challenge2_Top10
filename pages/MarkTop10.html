          <p>
            Red Dead Redemption is a cowboy action-adventure game developed by
            Rockstar Games. Yes I know what you might be thinking, "Why not Red
            Dead Redemption 2?" Don't get me wrong, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an
            amazing game but personally I've always liked the first one better.
            Red Dead Redemption came out in 2010 and was one of my favorite
            games even though I was 5 when it came out. I played this game
            around 2012 and it was incredible. It takes place in 1911 and you
            play as John Marston. John's family is kidnapped by the Bureau of
            Investigations to which the main plot of the story is you (John
            Marston) are forced to hunt down your former gang member in exchange
            for your family's return. Not only was the story of this game great,
            they later added this game mode called Undead Nightmare and man was
            it scary to play as a kid. Undead Nightmare had its own story but it
            wasn't as strong as the main one. The gamemodes story was John
            Marston sets out to find the cause/cure for a plague that has
            infected his wife and son. Like i said, story isn't the best but
            it's still a hell of a blast!

          <p>
            The Legends of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom... What a great game!
            Tears of the Kingdom is an open world action-adventure game and man,
            is this game absolutely amazing though I did love Breath of the Wild
            so I might be a little biased. In this game you play as Link, the
            Legendary Swordsman. You and the princess of Hyrule explore a cavern
            underneath Hyrule Castle to which a poisonous substance called gloom
            is being released. In trying to figure out what's happening, you
            release an evil spirit causing you to go into a coma. When you
            eventually wake up all of Hyrule is destroyed and Princess Zelda is
            missing. In this game you get crazy abilities that have completely
            changed the gameplay from the last game such as an arm that lets you
            combine stuff together to create more things out of eachother.
            Although I dont get around to playing this game as much anymore, I
            can't deny it's glory.

          <p>
            The Last Of Us is yet another action-adventure game where you
            traverse a post-apocylptic enviroment. Yes I know zombie games are
            over saturated by now but if you've never played The Last Of Us you
            definitely need to. In this game you play as two characters, Joel
            and Ellie. Joel loses his daughter in the havok of the outbreak and
            is eventually tasked with escorting a teenage girl (Ellie) across
            the United States. The reason for this job is because Ellie is
            immune to the zombie infection so she needs to be "researched". No
            more spoilers. When I played this game, I no lifed it and finished
            in 3-4 days, I was hooked and always wanted to know what would
            happen next. This game was one of the very few games i've played
            some-what recently that I have actually really enjoyed.

          <br />
          <p>
            I'm gonna say it. Left 4 Dead is better than Left 4 Dead 2. Left 4
            Dead is a first-person arcade-shooter where you can play as a group
            of survivors who are named Bill, Francis, Zoey, and Louis. Together
            you try your best to survive the aftermath of a zombie outbreak in
            the United States. Fighting hordes of zombies, throwing bombs and
            shooting all kinds of weapons. Simple gameplay yet very effective. I
            say Left 4 Dead is better than 2 because it feels as if they focused
            on making the atmosphere creepier and try to keep you on edge at all
            times. Left 4 Dead 2 leaned more towards the arcade-shooter side of
            things. I've played this game since I was about 5 and still manage
            to go back to it at least a couple of times a year. In my heart
            there is not a single zombie game that will top this one.

          <p>
            After being free'd from your cell by the emperor of Tamriel, You
            (the hero) must prevent the gates of Oblivion (Hell) from wreaking
            havok throughout the empire. This game's story is great but it's the
            gameplay that really pulled me in. Oblivion is one of the few games
            that makes me feel somewhat immersed (despite the bad graphics). The
            atmosphere of this game is unmatched from all the other Elder
            Scrolls games. This game is an open-world RPG to which there is
            plenty to explore. From small camps the enemies camp out at to fully
            decorated towns and even castles when you enter an Oblivion gate. I
            used to refuse to play this game when I could just be playing Skyrim
            but finally giving it a chance made me realize I was missing out on
            an amazing RPG.

          <p>
            Baldur's Gate 3 is RPG Adventure Strategy game in which you wake up
            in an alien ship and are infected with a alien tadpole (mindflayer).
            Then dragons and a race called the Githyanki warriors appear and
            start attacking the alien ship causing it to crash land. You and
            your party of 4, whether it be you controlling 4 Characters or
            playing with an actual party of 4, manage to somehow land safely to
            which you then traverse the lands to find a cure to your infection.
            This game is supposed to create a different story with each
            choice... and it suprisingly delivered that promise. If you like
            Dungeons and Dragons or have been interested in trying it, this game
            is a great choice for you and your friends.

            makes me so mad but it's to good to stop playing it. The story sucks
            so I'm not even gonna try to explain it. The PvP on the other hand
            has one of the best combat systems in all of fighting games in my
            opinion. You can play as 32 different heros from different factions
            whether it be Knights, Vikings, Samurai, or the Wu-Lin. Each
            character has it's own unique fighting style and abilities that you
            can fight other players with. There is no fighting game like it and
            it's so sad it wasn't more popular even though it had a rough
            launch.

            This game was a near master-piece for me. The only reason I actually
            played this game was because my mom bought it for a uncle and he
            would not shut up about it, With good reason of course. In this game
            you are the "One-Armed Wolf" a disgraced warrior with a single arm
            rescued from death itself. The one who saved you was the young lord
            who you now owe your life to for he has given you blood from an
            ancient bloodline that rejuvinates you. This blood comes with many
            troubles though because now you are hunted by many enemies. I beat
            this game a total of 7 times. Yes... 7. Each time start a new game
            it just gets more and more difficult but, since i'm a pro gamer or
            whatever its lightwork for me. The bosses in this game will make you
            want to punch a hole in the wall sometimes but once you master your
            blade the satisfaction is unmatched. 9/10 game for me right here.
            Maybe its time for an 8th play through soon, who knows.

          <p>
            Although it had a rough launch, Cyberpunk is one of my all time
            favorite games. You are put into the shoes of V and enter the
            amazing "NIGHT CITY!" You are then introduced to a choom named
            Jackie wells who puts you on a job that goes wrong that results in a
            bio-chip containing the engram of a terrorist in your mind? Or
            Bio-ware maybe? whatever. This bio-chip in question contains Johnny
            Silver-Hand, awesome punk-rockstar turned terrorist when he tried to
            blow up Arasaka Tower. The rest of the story you'll have to play the
            game for. I no lifed this game as well and currenty have 57 hours in
            the base story and am planning to start the DLC soon. This game is
            incredible the atmosphere is one of the best in all of gaming
            especially if you're a tech geek. With all the technology that
            changes what you can do gameplay wise this game has plenty of hours
            of fun for everyone.

            #1: Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater
          </h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Come on man thats a sick title for
            a game. What ever kojima was on when he made this game, every game
            developer should be on too. This is my all time favorite game. "What
            a thrill" this game was for me. I've never played a game for more
            hours straight then i played this game. I was staying up to six in
            the morning just to play this game. Set in 1964 you play as a FOX
            operative codenamed Naked Snake. Snake sets out to rescue a russian
            rocket scientest and sabotage a experimental super weapon "THE METAL
            GEAR". This games story will never be matched and I wish i could
            play it for the first time again. Everything from the gameplay to
            the greatest sound track ever is just so amazing it's seriously a
            piece of art. Not to mention the best main theme in all of gaming!
            This game will always be #1 for me, I dont even think the new remake
            coming out will be anywhere near as good as the original. I'm still
            gonna buy it though!
