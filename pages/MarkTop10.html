            <p>
              Red dead redemption is a cowboy action-adventure game developed by Rockstar Games. Yes i know what you might be thinking, Why not red dead redemption 2? Don't get me wrong, red dead redemption 2 is an amazing game but personally i've always liked the first one better. Red dead redemption came out in 2010 and was one of my favorite games even though i was 5 when it came out. I played this game around 2012 and it was incredible. It takes place in 1911 and you play as John Marston. Johns family is kidnapped by the Bureau of Investigations to which the main plot of the story is you (John Marston) are forced to hunt down your former gang member in exchange for your families return. Not only was the story of this game great, They later added this game mode called Undead Nightmare and man was it scary to play as a kid. Undead Nightmare had its own story but it wasn't as strong as the main one. The gamemodes story was John Marston sets out to find the cause/cure for a plague that has infected his wife and son. Like i said, story isnt the best but it's still a hell of a blast!

            <p>
              The Legends of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom... What a great game! Tears of the Kingdom is an open world action-adventure game and man, is this game absolutely amazing though i did love breath of the wild so i might be a little biased. In this game you play as Link the Legendary Swordsman. You and the princess of Hyrule explore a cavern underneath Hyrule Castle to which a poisonous substance called gloom is being released. In trying to figure out whats happening you release an evil spirit causing you to go into a coma. When you eventually wake up all of Hyrule is destroyed and Princess Zelda is missing. In this game you get crazy abilities that have completely changed the gameplay from the last game such as an arm that lets you combine stuff together to create more things out of eachother. Although I dont get around to playing this game as much anymore, I can't deny it's glory.

              #8: The Last Of Us
            </h1>
            <p>
              The Last Of Us is yet another action-adventure game where you traverse a post-apocylptic enviroment. Yes I know zombie games are over saturated by now but if you've never played The Last Of Us you definitely need to. In this game you play as two characters, Joel and Ellie. Joel loses his daughter in the havok of the outbreak and is eventually tasked with escorting a teenage girl (Ellie) across the United States. The reason for this job is because Ellie is immune to the zombie infection so she needs to be "researched". No more spoilers. When i played this game i no lifed it and finished in 3-4 days, I was hooked and always wanted to know what would happen next. This game was one of the very few games i've played some-what recently that I have actually really enjoyed.

            <p>
              I'm gonna say it. Left 4 Dead is better than Left 4 Dead 2. Left 4 Dead is a first-person arcade-shooter where you can play as a group of survivors who are named Bill, Francis, Zoey, and Luis. Together you try your best to survive the aftermath of a zombie outbreak in the United States. Fighting hordes of zombies throwing bombs and shooting all kinds of weapons. Simple gameplay yet very effective. I say Left 4 Dead is better than 2 because it feels as if they focused on making the atmosphere creepier and try to keep you on edge at all times. Left 4 Dead 2 leaned more towards the arcade-shooter side of things. I've played this game since I was about 5 and still manage to go back to it at least a couple of times a year. In my heart there is not a single zombie game that will top this one.

            <p>
              After being free'd from your cell by the emperor of Tamriel, You (the hero) must prevent the gates of Oblivion (Hell) from wreaking havok throughout the empire. This games story great but it's the gameplay that really pulled me in. Oblivion is one of the few games that makes me feel somewhat immersed (despite the bad graphics). The atmosphere of this game is unmatched from all the other elder scrolls games. This game is an open-world RPG to which there is plenty to explore. from small camps the enemies camp out at to fully decorated towns and even castles when you enter a Oblivion gate. I used to refuse to play this game when i could just be playing skyrim but finally giving it a chance made me realize I was missing out on an amazing RPG.

            <p>
              Baldurs Gate 3 is RPG Adventure Strategy game in which you wake up in an alien ship and are infected with a alien tadpole (mindflayer). Then dragons and a race called the Githyanki warriors appear and start attacking the alien ship causing it to crash land. You and your party of 4 wether it be you controlling 4 Characters or playing with an actual party of 4, manage to somehow land safely to which you then traverse the lands to find a cure to your infection. This game is supposed to create a different story with each choice... and it suprisingly delivered that promise. If you like Dungeons and Dragons or have been interested in trying it this game is a great choice for you and your friends.

              For honor... man, screw this game. I absolutely despise this game and everytime i play it I just wanna throw away my computer. I say this but i'll admit it I'M AN ADDICT, A fiend if you will. This game makes me so mad but it's to good to stop playing it. The story sucks so i'm not even gonna try to explain it. The PvP on the other hand has one of the best combat systems in all of fighting games in my opinion. You can play as 32 different heros from different factions whether it be Knights, Vikings, Samurai, or the Wu-Lin. Each character has it's own unique fighting style and abilities that you can fight other players with. There is no fighting game like it and it's so sad it wasn't more popular even though it had a rough launch.

            <p>
              This game was a near master-piece for me. The only reason I actually played this game was because my mom bought it for a uncle and he would not shut up about it, With good reason of course. In this game you are the "One-armed Wold" a disgraced warrior with a single arm rescued from death itself. The one who saved you was the young lord who you now owe your life to for he has given you blood from an ancient bloodline that rejuvinates you. This blood comes with many troubles though because now you are hunted by many enemies. I beat this game a total of 7 times. Yes... 7. Each time start a new game it just gets more and more difficult but, since i'm a pro gamer or whatever its lightwork for me. The bosses in this game will make you want to punch a hole in the wall sometimes but once you master your blade the satisfaction is unmatched. 9/10 game for me right here. Maybe its time for an 8th play through soon, who knows.

              Although it had a rough launch Cyberpunk is one of my all time favorite games. You are put into the shoes of V and enter the amazing "NIGHT CITY!" You are then introduced to a choom named Jackie wells who puts you on a job that goes wrong that results in a bio-chip containing the engram of a terrorist in your mind? Or Bio-ware maybe? whatever.  This bio chip in question contains Johnny Silver-Hand awesome punk-rockstar turned terrorist when he tried to blow up arasaka tower. The rest of the story you'll have to play the game for. I no lifed this game as well and currenty have 57 hours in the base story and am planning to start the dlc soon. This game is incredible the atmosphere is one of the best in all of gaming especially if you're a tech geek. With all the technology that changes what you can do gameplay wise this game has plenty of hours of fun for everyone.

            <p>
              Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Come on man thats a sick title for a game. What ever kojima was on when he made this game, every game developer should be on too. This is my all time favorite game. "What a thrill" this game was for me. I've never played a game for more hours straight then i played this game. I was staying up to six in the morning just to play this game. Set in 1964 you play as a FOX operative codenamed Naked Snake. Snake sets out to rescue a russian rocket scientest and sabotage a experimental super weapon "THE METAL GEAR". This games story will never be matched and I wish i could play it for the first time again. Everything from the gameplay to the greatest sound track ever is just so amazing it's seriously a piece of art. Not to mention the best main theme in all of gaming! This game will always be #1 for me, I dont even think the new remake coming out will be anywhere near as good as the original. I'm still gonna buy it though!
