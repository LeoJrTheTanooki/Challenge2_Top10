Reviewer Notes: Site looks really good, the animated icons for each others list was really cool to see. The list set up was really nice and the spacing in between was good to where it didn't clutter the screen. Only feedback I would have for it is the title says game recommendations and one list says game recommendations and the other list is underated indie games so I was a bit confused as to why they weren't the same type of list. Overall nice site and the colors go well together
